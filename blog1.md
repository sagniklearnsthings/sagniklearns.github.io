Hello everyone !
I am a graduate student in physical sciences at IISER Mohali DPS. I do not have much more to say about me. Just to say, I share interest in every mystries, just like every other human being on this planet. No different at all ;) To be honest I share a bit more interest about the mystries of the outer space. But no worries, I can join hour long discussions on ``Bermuda Triangle''. I have turned 23 in the year 2025. I like chocolates. And yes, aliens exist ! I do believe ;)
